# The andromeda project

The andromeda project is a project that has the goal of completely reimplementing [Cosmos](https://github.com/CosmosOS/Cosmos).

However, this does not mean that we are going to reimplement XSharp & IL2CPU from scratch (at least right now).

Instead, we are going to reimplement Cosmos. This means the entire Cosmos namespace, Cosmos plugs, builder, and more Cosmos stuff that is not IL2CPU/XSharp.
