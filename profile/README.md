# The andromeda project

The andromeda project is a project that has the goal of creating a modern rewrite of [Cosmos](https://github.com/CosmosOS/Cosmos).

However, this does not mean that we are going to rewrite XSharp & IL2CPU from scratch (at least right now).

Instead, we are going to rewrite Cosmos. This means the entire Cosmos namespace, Cosmos plugs, builder, and more Cosmos stuff that is not IL2CPU/XSharp.
