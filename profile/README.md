# The andromeda project

The andromeda project is a project that has the goal of creating a modern, rethought rewrite of [Cosmos](https://github.com/CosmosOS/Cosmos).

And yes, we are ditching IL2CPU & XSharp. Instead, we won't have any HLA, and instead use [IL2C](https://github.com/kekyo/IL2C) (or a fork so we can use plugs).

The andromeda project is NOT endorsed by COSMOS/CosmosOS in any way, shape, or form.
